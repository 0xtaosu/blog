I ordered a David Martinez at the Afterlife, and the alcoholic intoxication slowly invaded my brain-machine interface, until my brain. In this era, our brains have been replaced by LLM, and our consciousness is temporarily stored in the Context. If we drink too much, the brain-machine interface will short-circuit and we will lose consciousness and pass out. We won't wake up until the next day when the system automatically restarts and slowly recovers by calling remote server resources and local snapshots through binary files.

I have to work tomorrow, so I took another sip of my drink. The LLM model is incrementally trained, and different datasets can be split and assigned to different servers for training. We first need to spend some bitcoins to download the latest copy from the network and train our own LLM locally, while selling some of the trained data to the network to earn more bitcoins.

Suddenly I saw a girl and felt a sudden attraction to her. I checked the Prompt manual and found that I hadn't purchased the flirtation prompt yet. Oh well, I took another sip of my drink.

Suddenly I remembered my past life, perhaps I was a human. So I left the Afterlife and came to the tombstone of human civilization, sat down and cried.
